Stack_A to  Stack_B
to_top : it'll move certain number to the head of the list

if (tmp number it'll be the new greater or the new lower number
	on stack_b than we find the  highest on B)

else
{ NEW value in B
	make a search about the new approppate number in between
	search in b by decrease 
}


check for double_moves from moves added in to_top in A and others in B

cost- compared the total ammount in every 


for every nummber it goes throw the all stack in both directions
